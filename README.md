# Portfolio

With this project I've built a professional portfolio site using HTML and CSS.


## User Story

AS A web developer

I WANT a deployed portfolio

SO THAT I can showcase my applications to potential employers and clients


## Business Context

Through my portfolio I want to have a good first point of contact for employers looking to fill a position or clients in need of a developer to complete a project. I want to make it clean and informative so it showcases my strongest work as a developer that way it will lead to employment and/or more clients.


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN that an employer or client wants to hire a developer
